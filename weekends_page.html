    <h1>My Weekend Meals 11/6- 11/7</h1>

    <h2>A brief description of my weekend Meals</h2>
    <p>
        As you can clearly seen in my weekday meal patterns, I am not a morning person during weekdays at all!
        <br>
        But my meal schedules during weekend is slightly different from that during weekdays lol. 
        <br>
        More personal time allows me to do some complex dishes or try new recipes out.
        <br>
        I commonly use weekends as two big-cheat days so that I can enjoy some food I have desired during the entire week, which I have to praise myself a lot of making such outstanding meals!

    <p>
        The new recipe I try out in this week is the Koren Kimchee, which turns out really successful and decilious! <br>
        It's high quality and texture can been seen from its blimshed chili color and the juicy sauce underneath the chinese cabbage! <br>
        I will put picture of the Kimchee in the Recipe Page and attach an hyperlink of its recipe at the bottom of this page. <br>
        So if you are interested in that sort of thing just go checking out!<br>

        Yeah! So just take a look underneath and enjoy! :)
