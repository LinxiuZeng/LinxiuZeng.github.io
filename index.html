    <h2>A Brief Introduction </h2>
    <p>
        Hello and thank you for visiting my page! I am currently living in one of the apartments near school and I usually make my own meals everyday.
        <br>
        But that's not all the cases, I still dine outside, order takeout food, or simply order by apps if I am too lazy to make one.
        <br>
        Working in one of the school food market also offers me a 5-dollar voucher twice or three times a week, which I can use to pay the bills for food in the market.
        <br>
        Therefore, if you notice some very familiar containers while skimming my websites, don't be too suprised lol.
    </p>
